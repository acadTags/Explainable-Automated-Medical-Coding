The label subsumption relations (knowledge bases) are stored here as .csv files before running the program.

Two types of format are allowed for the .csv files.
* Two elements in each row: 
  ```
  hyponym,hypernym
  robin,bird
  ```
* Three elements in each row, with the third column showing whether the subsumption relation holds.
  In this case, only the "true" relations will be used.
  ```
  wrong_hyponym,wrong_hypernym,false
  robin,cat,false
  
  hyponym,hypernym,true
  robin,bird,true
  ```
  
For ICD-9 codes, examples of the subsumption relations are:
  ```
  83.72,83.7
  987.8,987
  80.23,80.2
  ```
