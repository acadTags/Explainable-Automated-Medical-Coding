Keep this folder in the program. The vocabulary information, label information, label similarity matrix and label subsumption matrix for each dataset are stored here after the first run.

For MIMIC-III-50, the relevant files to be automatically generated to this folder are:
* mimic3-ds-50-HAN_word_vocabulary.pik, the word-to-index and index-to-word dictionaries
* mimic3-ds-50-HAN_label_vocabulary.pik, the label-to-index and index-to-label dictionaries
* mimic3-ds-50_label_sim_0.pik, the label similarity matrix (not used in this study, but required for the program)
* icd9-50_label_sub.pik, the label subsumption matrix (not used in this study, but required for the program)

A similar set of files are generated when processing the other datasets for the first time.

The files in the folder are required to run the Jupyter Notebook demo [```demo_HLAN_viz.ipynb```](https://github.com/acadTags/ExplainableAutomated-Medical-Coding/blob/master/HLAN/demo_HLAN_viz.ipynb).
