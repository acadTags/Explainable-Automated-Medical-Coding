The two ```.py``` files shows how to train word and label embeddings with the Python Gensim package. We used the Continuous Bag of Words algorihtm with negative sampling and set window size as 5, mininum frequency threshold (```min_count```) as 0.

The pre-trained word and label embedding files are available at Onedrive, [link](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ACZVuCnEV2zDKow&id=22F95C44F607EC5B%21255141&cid=22F95C44F607EC5B).
